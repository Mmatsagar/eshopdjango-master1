# eshopdjango-master1
Audience of django-SHOP users Specifically, we aim at providing a clean, modular and Pythonic/Djangonic implementation of an e-commerce framework, that a moderately experienced Django developer should be able to pick up and run easily. Pure Django models are used to describe each product type, and so the Django admin can be used to build a minimalistic editor for each of them.
